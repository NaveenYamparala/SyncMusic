# SyncMusic

SyncMusic is an android app which amplifies the audio by playing the audio synchronously across android mobile devices. For this to happen, this app must be installed on all the participating devices.
Initially, upon startup, the user will be asked to Log-In. If not already registered, the user can sign up by clicking sign up and going to the sign-up screen.
Once signed up or logged in, Options screen will be opened which shows the user two options
• Host a music party 
• Join a music party
If the user chose to host the music party, he/she has to either upload the music file or paste the music file URL to play in the specified text box and the audio starts playing when the user clicks on the play button.
If the user chooses to join a party, then a new screen is opened which includes all the active users that are currently hosting a party i.e. playing audio. The user can join a party by clicking the Join button. Then, the song that the host is already playing will be simultaneously played on the user’s device amplifying the sound level.
The user can logout whenever he needs using the Sign out button.
